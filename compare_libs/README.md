# What do we have.

2 versions of ivy artifact (zipped archive with dozens of libraries) - old (stable) and new (feature)
Need to test, that new version has the same amount of libs as the old one.

# Goal:
Compare lists in 2 archives, or compare list of new archive with pre-defined list

Maximum useful:
 - download 2 archives
 - unpack them
 - read filenames for given extension (.lib. .dll,  .a, etc.)
 - compare them
 - calculate hashes (optional)
